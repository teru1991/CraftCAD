# Drawing PDF + Dimensions (v1)

## Minimal Dimension Policy
- Export includes part outlines and part labels.
- For each part, include axis-aligned bbox dimensions (`width x height`).
- Dimension text style is fixed in exporter (single standard size).
- Arrow style is fixed (minimal line-end markers in v1).

## Scope Limits
- v1 drawing PDF supports line/polyline-based geometry and parts.
- Higher-order dimensions (radial, ordinate, chain) are out of scope.
